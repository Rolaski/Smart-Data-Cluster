# Smart Data Cluster

This project is a data analysis and clustering application built with Streamlit. It provides multiple machine learning algorithms for data clustering and association analysis. Users can explore the following features:

* Association Analysis using the Apriori algorithm to detect frequent itemsets and association rules.
* K-Means Clustering for dividing data into a specified number of clusters.
* DBSCAN Clustering to identify dense clusters and handle noise in the data.
* Hierarchical Clustering with a dendrogram visualization for analyzing cluster relationships.
* Additional Clustering Methods like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Spectral Clustering for more advanced data segmentation
